# POS App - Point of Sales with Admin and Agents

A React Native-based Point of Sale (POS) application designed for managing product sales with distinct roles for admins and agents. Admins can create products, assign them to agents, and monitor real-time sales data, while agents sell products to customers using manual payment methods. The app includes features like Bluetooth printing, Google Drive backup, barcode generation/scanning, stock management, and invoice generation.

## Description

The **POS App** is a mobile application built to streamline sales operations for businesses with a distributed workforce. It consists of two main components:
- **Admin App**: Allows administrators to create products with limited stock and weight, assign them to agents, manage stock levels, and view real-time sales reports across multiple agents.
- **Agent App**: Enables agents to sell products to customers, process manual payments, generate invoices, and manage stock updates.

The app supports offline capabilities with features like Bluetooth printing and Google Drive backups, ensuring flexibility and data security without relying on third-party payment gateways.

## Features

- **Role-Based Access**:
  - **Admin**: Create products, assign them to agents, monitor sales, and manage stock.
  - **Agent**: Sell products, process manual payments, and generate invoices.
- **Product Management**: Add, remove, or update products with stock limits and weights.
- **Real-Time Sales Data**: Admins can view live sales reports from all agents.
- **Bluetooth Printing**: Print invoices directly from the app via Bluetooth printers.
- **Google Drive Backup**: Securely back up sales and stock data to Google Drive.
- **Barcode Support**: Generate and scan barcodes for efficient product handling.
- **Stock Management**: Track and update stock levels in real-time.
- **Invoice Generation**: Automatically generate invoices during payment processing.
- **Manual Payment Methods**: Supports cash, credit, or other manual payment options (no external payment gateways).
- **Reports**: Detailed sales and stock reports for admins.

## Tech Stack

- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile app development framework.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for logic and functionality.
- **Firebase (Assumed)**: For real-time database and authentication (based on typical POS app needs; adjust if not used).
- **Bluetooth Libraries**: For printer integration (e.g., `react-native-ble-plx` or similar).
- **Google Drive API**: For cloud backups (via a suitable RN library like `react-native-google-drive-api-wrapper`).
- **Barcode Libraries**: For generation and scanning (e.g., `react-native-barcode-builder`, `react-native-camera`).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the POS App locally:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or Yarn
- React Native CLI
- Android Studio (for Android) or Xcode (for iOS)
- A physical device or emulator for testing

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aravindhan-Senthilkumar/Point_of_sales_App.git
   cd Point_of_sales_App
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Firebase (if applicable)**:
   - Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com).
   - Add your Firebase configuration to a `firebase.js` file in the project root.
   - Enable Firestore and Authentication (if used).

4. **Configure Google Drive API (if applicable)**:
   - Set up a Google Cloud project and enable the Drive API.
   - Add your API credentials to the app (consult library documentation).

5. **Link Native Modules**:
   - For Bluetooth, barcode scanning, or other native features:
     ```bash
     npx react-native link
     ```
   - Ensure proper permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` (Android) and `Info.plist` (iOS).

6. **Run the App**:
   - For Android:
     ```bash
     npx react-native run-android
     ```
   - For iOS:
     ```bash
     npx react-native run-ios
     ```

## Usage

### Admin App
1. **Login**: Sign in with admin credentials.
2. **Create Products**: Add products with details like name, weight, stock, and price.
3. **Assign to Agents**: Allocate products to specific agents.
4. **Monitor Sales**: View real-time sales data and reports.
5. **Manage Stock**: Add, remove, or adjust stock levels.
6. **Backup Data**: Sync data to Google Drive manually or automatically.

### Agent App
1. **Login**: Sign in with agent credentials.
2. **View Products**: See assigned products and stock levels.
3. **Sell Products**: Scan barcodes or manually select items, then process manual payments (e.g., cash/credit).
4. **Generate Invoice**: Create and print invoices via Bluetooth printer after payment.
5. **Update Stock**: Automatically reduce stock upon sale completion.

### Notes
- **Assumptions**: I assumed Firebase might be used for real-time data since it’s common in such apps. If you’re using a different backend (e.g., local storage, another API), let me know, and I’ll adjust the README.
- **Libraries**: Specific libraries for Bluetooth, Google Drive, and barcode features weren’t mentioned, so I included placeholders. Replace them with the actual ones you used (e.g., `react-native-ble-manager` for Bluetooth).
- **Repo Link**: Replace `https://github.com/Aravindhan-Senthilkumar/Point_of_sales_App.git` with your actual repository URL.
- **Enhancements**: You can add screenshots, a demo video link, or badges (e.g., build status) to make the README more appealing.

Copy this text into a `README.md` file in your repository’s root directory. If you’d like me to refine it further (e.g., add specific library names, tweak sections, or include a logo), just let me know!
